# Crowdfunding: A Game Changer
This is the era of blockchain and crowdfunding. This is the era of disruption. The emerging crypto market is comprised of a new and distinct set of investors and entrepreneurs. A new economic ecosystem has surfaced, causing substantial disruptions to the traditional payment services and banking industry. Revolutionary digital assets like BTC, ETH, XRP (and many others) are generating new archetypes for financial transactions and creating alternate channels of wealth.

Blockchain is the art of permanently and securely recording a limitless amount of transactions in an impenetrable cryptic block of algorithmic code/fun, with a wide range of variables and alternatives providing multiple opportunities for customization. Talented entrepreneurs can now quickly get financial support for their projects, and investors canget the opportunity to invest in another “Steve Jobs” or “Elon Musk” at the early stage of success of their projects and benefit from them.
